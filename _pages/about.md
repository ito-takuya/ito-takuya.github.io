I am a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University working with [John Murray](https://murraylab.org). I was previously a PhD student at Rutgers University with [Michael Cole](https://www.colelab.org/).

I am based in NYC.

### Research Interest

I study information processing in brains and neural models. More recently, my specific interests lie in understanding the structure of multi-task and compositional neural representations, and how they emerge in natural and artificial settings. My motivation is twofold: 1) To understand properties of the brain to better inform the design of computational models (e.g., to achieve and excede human-like performance); 2) To better understand cognitive/computational deficits in psychiatric illnesses. In the past, I have used human fMRI and non-human primate electrophysiology, though I also have interests in other empirical data modalities.

I also have methodological interests in neural network modeling, network science, dynamical systems theory, and ML/statistics.
